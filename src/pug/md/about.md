# Profile
I am a Front End Developer, UI and UX with 8+ years of experience. I am pro-active and very responsible.
Good communication skills, teamwork and leadership. I like constant growth, new knowledge and challenges.
I have worked in many development projects and all the stages I saw the importance of teamwork and assertive
communication; this is vital to find new and better solutions to problems working with agile methodologies like
scrum.
